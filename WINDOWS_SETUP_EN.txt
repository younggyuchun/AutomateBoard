   HansomangAutomation.exe
   setup_playwright.bat
   USER_MANUAL_EN.txt (this file)

Step 2: Run setup (FIRST TIME ONLY)
   Double-click: setup_playwright.bat
   Wait for completion (3-5 minutes)

Step 3: Run the program
   Double-click: HansomangAutomation.exe

2. setup_playwright.bat (browser installer)
3. USER_MANUAL_EN.txt (user guide in English)
4. 사용설명서.txt (user guide in Korean - optional)


Common Issues on English Windows
=================================

Issue: Korean text appears as garbage/boxes
Solution: This is normal on English Windows
         Use the _EN.txt files for English documentation
         The GUI application will still work correctly

Issue: "playwright command not found"
Solution: Already fixed - script uses "python -m playwright"

Issue: Permission denied
Solution: Right-click and "Run as Administrator"


Technical Notes
===============

- The application GUI may still show Korean text
- This is by design for Korean users
- All functionality works the same regardless of Windows language
- Browser automation works on any Windows language version
